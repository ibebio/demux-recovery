* Illumina demultiplexing recovery

This tool is intended to perform demultiplexing when no index reads
are available. It works by determining the minimal required barcode
length, searching for the adapter sequence in the read and, if
successful, attempting to match the subsequent barcode with one of the
sample barcodes. The output is written to FASTQ files.

The adapter and the sample names and barcodes are provided in a YAML
file (samples.yaml). This file needs to be created for each
demultiplexing run. Additional configuration for the adapter matching
and barcode length settings is located in the file
demux_recovery.yaml.

The script requires Biopython to run, and was written with Python 3.6.


** Example: 
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./demux_recovery.py --input_fastq Undetermined_S0_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz --samples_file samples.yaml --output_dir . --log_level DEBUG
#+END_SRC
